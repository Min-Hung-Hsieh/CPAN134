        <h2>Taiwan Introduction:</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Taiwan is an island in the Pacific, and today it is home to different
          groups of people, including Fujian, Hakka, Chinese from other
          provinces, Taiwanese indigenous people, and Southeast Asian
          immigrants. Before World War II, Taiwan was a colony of Japan. In
          1895, due to the failure of the First Sino-Japanese War, China ceded
          Taiwan, Liaodong Peninsula, and other areas to Japan. After World War
          II, the government of the Republic of China (ROC) moved to Taiwan and
          began building the island. When the ROC government arrived in Taiwan
          in 1949, nearly two million soldiers and their families also moved to
          Taiwan. At that time, there were many things that the ROC government
          needed to address.
          <br />
          <br />
          When World War II ended in 1945, Taiwan's economic and health
          conditions were very low, and the ROC government had a significant
          impact on Taiwan's development by transforming the economic entity
          from agriculture to high-tech industries. From the 1960s to the 1980s,
          a series of serious new policies and development plans industrialized
          Taiwan. The National Statistics Bureau of Taiwan stated that in 1965,
          the per capita GDP was $229, and 30 years later, in 1984, the per
          capita GDP had increased to $3,225.

          Taiwan is a small island in the Pacific. It is adjacent to China, and
          the indigenous people on the island are considered to be the origin of
          the Austronesian language family in the Pacific islands. The land area
          of Taiwan is 13,972 square kilometers, and there are approximately
          23.8 million people living on the island.
