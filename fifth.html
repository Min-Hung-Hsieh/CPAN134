        <p>
          Welcome to my website! My name is Milo and I was a Semiconductor
          Engineer in Taiwan. Now I am a student at Humber College with a strong
          passion for technology and programming.
          <br /><br />
          I graduated from Union University and I major Electronic Engineering
          where I focused on semiconductor process development. Following my
          graduation, I joined Brooks Automation where I gained valuable
          experience in semiconductor machine maintenance and provided technical
          guidance to customers. During this time, I was exposed to software
          data and discovered a keen interest in programming. To further develop
          my skills, I decided to pursue additional education at Humber College.
