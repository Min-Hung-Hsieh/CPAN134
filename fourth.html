          Taiwan's Economic Takeoff
          <hr />
        </h1>
        <p>
          After the 1980s, the Taiwan government began implementing different
          economic policies, transforming the industrial structure from "heavy
          industry" to "technology-intensive industries". Technology-intensive
          industries include optoelectronics, computers, computer integrated
          manufacturing, and semiconductor industries, etc. Just like the
          processing zone before, the government established a special area for
          investors to build factories. This special area is called the "Science
          Park". Within the science park, there are many brands producing large
          quantities of semiconductor products. For example, TSMC, UMC,
          MediaTek, etc. The technology headquarters of these Taiwanese brands
          are all located within the Hsinchu Science Park. According to a report
          by the Liberty Times website last year, the total revenue of the
          science park exceeded 8.5 trillion US dollars in 2018. The
          semiconductor industry contributes significantly to Taiwan's GDP.
