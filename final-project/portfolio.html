          <h2>Wharariki Beach</h2>
          <p>
            Wharariki Beach is undoubtedly one of the most photographed beaches
            in the Nelson Tasman region, and people the world over admire the
            dramatic Golden Bay landscapes that emblazon their Windows 10
            screensavers.
            <br /><br />
            A scattering of caves, rocks and arches adorn the coast of
            Wharariki, shaped entirely by the elements of the wild, west coast.
            A short walk through coastal forest and rolling pastures reveals a
            beach so large you could explore it for days.
            <br /><br />
            The scenery at Wharariki Beach easily rivals the recognised wonders
            of the world, and it is easy to while away a day exploring this
            wondrous coastal playground.

          <h2>Janie Seddon Shipwreck</h2>
          <p>
            Janie began her career as a submarine mining vessel and was the last
            surviving military ship to have served in both world wars - rumour
            has it she even fired the first shot in WW2.
            <br /><br />
            When her military days came to an end, Janie was purchased by the
            local Talley’s fishing group as the first in their fleet. As a
            coal-powered ship, she proved unsuitable as a fishing vessel and her
            size prevented her from operating in the coastal waters of Tasman
            Bay. In 1950, the Janie Seddon was laid up on the Motueka Wharf, and
            after sinking at her moorings a few years later she was stripped of
            anything of use and left to the elements.
            <br /><br />
            To this day, Janie’s rusting hull rests on the coast of Motueka and
            a short stroll along the foreshore will take you to her unofficial
            burial site. Photographers travel from near and far to capture this
            iconic shipwreck on camera, but for your own safety we advise to
            appreciate her beauty without climbing inside or ontop of the hull.

          <h2>Roys peak</h2>
          <p>
            New Zealand is famous for its breathtaking hiking trails that wind
            and weave their way through its beautiful landscapes. However, there
            are a few hikes that really stand out from the rest. These are the
            hikes that literally take your breath away – Roys Peak is one of
            those hikes.
            <br /><br />
            It’s safe to say that Roys Peak is now one of the most popular hikes
            in New Zealand. Its most famous view is from a viewpoint just shy of
            the summit where you can take a breathtaking photo overlooking Lake
            Wanaka.
            <br /><br />
            The trail is 8 km (5.3 miles) long and elevates almost 1300 m (4265
            ft). This makes Roys Peak a medium to hard hike, depending on your
            fitness level. While it isn’t overly long, the steep incline the
            majority of the way up is tiring, especially for those who don’t
            exercise regularly.

          <h2>Mt cook</h2>
          <p>
            Mt Cook, the tallest mountain in New Zealand.
            <br /><br />
            Aoraki Mount Cook National Park is home of the highest mountains and
            the longest glaciers. It is alpine in the purest sense - with
            skyscraping peaks, glaciers and permanent snow fields, all set under
            a star-studded sky.
            <br /><br />
            Although Aoraki Mount Cook encompasses 23 peaks over 3000 metres
            high, it is very accessible. State Highway 80 leads to Aoraki/Mt
            Cook Village which is situated beside scenic Lake Pukaki and
            provides a comfortable base for alpine activities. Far from city
            lights, the stargazing here is magnificent - Aoraki Mount Cook
            National Park forms the majority of New Zealand's only International
            Dark Sky Reserve.
            <br /><br />
            Mountaineers regard the area to be the best climbing region in
            Australasia, while less skilled adventurers find plenty of
            satisfaction with the mountain walks that lead to alpine tarns, herb
            fields and spectacular glacier views. Encounters with cheeky kea
            (mountain parrots) are part of the fun.

          <h2>Peters Lookout</h2>
          <p>
            Peters Lookout on the scenic road to Mount Cook offers one of the
            best road views in New Zealand. From the viewpoint, Mt Cook Road
            gently snakes its way underneath the Ben Ohau Range, just beside the
            turquoise-coloured Lake Pukakai.
            <br /><br />
            Peters Lookout on the road to Mount Cook offers one of those
            bucket-list road trip photo snaps. On a clear day, views from the
            lookout and the road reach far out to the incredible Aoraki (Mount
            Cook).
