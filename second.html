          375 Reduction of Rents
          <hr />
        </h1>
        <p class="p1">
          The first land policy was the "375 Reduction of Rents." During Japan's
          rule over Taiwan, landlords who owned a significant amount of land had
          control over who could rent in a particular area, where demand was
          high but the land belonged to a small group of people. Tenants were
          required to give all their crops to the landlord, except for seed.
          Even in the event of natural disasters or crop failures, they still
          had to provide all their rent to the landlord. The rent was previously
          called "Mandatory Rentals," which meant that their rights were not
          protected, and they had to give up everything even if they did not
          have sufficient rights. The first land policy aimed to change this
          situation. The Republic of China government previously implemented a
          50% rent policy in China, which meant that rent could not be higher
          than 50% of the crop. In April 1949, Taiwan Province President Chen
          Cheng announced a new land policy, "Reduction of Rents for Cultivated
          Land by 37.5%." It reduced 50% of the rent by 25%, resulting in the
          following formula:
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="text">50% x (1-0.25) = 37.5%</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Landlords may not charge rent in advance. If there is a crop
            failure, the rent should be even lower.
          </li>
          <li>The rental contract should be no less than six years.</li>
          <li>
            If the contract expires and the landlord does not intend to take it
            back for self-cultivation, it should be rented to the tenant.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the landlord plans to sell the land, the tenant has the right of
            first refusal.
          </li>
          <li>
            A rent association should be established in each town to handle land
            disputes or conflicts.

          Public land sales and distribution
          <hr />
        </h1>
        <p class="p1">
          The following policy refers to the "sale of public land". According to
          the report of Taiwan's National Development Council, public land in
          Taiwan is owned by the Japanese government, private companies, and
          individuals. The land area is approximately 1,760 square kilometers.
          From 1951 to 1976, the Republic of China government conducted 9
          transactions of public land sales. The land price was 2.5 times the
          annual rice production of the land. People had to pay the price for
          ten years through crops or cash. The purpose of this policy was to
          make people self-sufficient. This policy benefited 2.88627 million
          households, and the total area of land sold was 1,397,570,000 square
          meters.

          Land Cultivation Program
          <hr />
        </h1>
        <p class="p1">
          In 1953, two years after the "sale of public land", the Republic of
          China government announced a new land policy, namely the "Land
          Cultivation Program". This policy allowed landlords to retain only a
          portion of their land, and then the government would take it away and
          distribute it to the people. Landlords received some compensation from
          the government, including shares of government-owned companies.
