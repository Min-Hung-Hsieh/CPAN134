          The first policy is the "Rice and Fertilizer Barter Program". This
          policy was "rice in exchange for fertilizer". Farmers could not buy
          any fertilizer themselves; instead, the government controlled 100% of
          the fertilizer; The only source of fertilizer was the government. The
          exchange rate was 1.5 kg of fertilizer: 1 kg of rice. By implementing
          this policy, the government has achieved some positive results.
          According to the Taiwan Encyclopedia, the following are the results.
          1. The government reduced the income of farmers, as the income of the
          industry was relatively high, so the farmers in rural areas, the women
          of the family came to the factory. It increased the labor supply. 2.
          By doing this, the government controlled the rice in the market, so
          they were able to control the price of rice and lower it. The price of
          rice became more stable. 3. The government bought rice at a lower
          price, and then they used the money to pay government workers,
          teachers, and soldiers.

          The R.O.C. government has set up many protections for Taiwan's
          "immature industries" so that Taiwan can develop products with low
          technology requirements, low investment, high labor force, and
          national needs. 1. Restrict the import of food, soap, clothing and
          other items. 2. Raise import tariffs. 3. Lower export tariffs. The
          purpose of all these policies was to encourage "light industry" to
          produce for Taiwan's needs. According to the Taiwan Encyclopedia, by
          1954, there were no textile imports, and by 1957, the cement industry
          was producing enough to stop importing any cement.

          After "import substitution", there are many reasons to take the next
          step. According to the Taiwan Encyclopedia, there are more than a
          million people on farms who need work because of the great advances in
          agricultural production technology. Also, since 1958, the demand
          within Taiwan is too small and the factories are producing more than
          the demand, so they need to sell their products overseas. On the other
          hand, the government also encouraged other countries to invest in
          Taiwan. In September 1960, the government announced the Investment
          Encouragement Ordinance, reduced export tariffs, and established the
          Export Processing Zone. This unique area attracted investors to build
          factories and then export their products to the rest of the world,
          hence the term "export-oriented" development. 679/5000 Export
          Processing Zones (EPZs) are now an important development. The
          Taiwanese government has created a special zone in the seaport and
          encouraged investors to build factories, thereby reducing export
          tariffs, rents, etc. The Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone is the first
          of its kind in the world. Products produced in this zone are not
          subject to duty until they are exported. The great success of the EPZ
          in Taiwan has brought many job opportunities. Today, Kaohsiung is the
          second largest city in Taiwan. The Port of Kaohsiung is also the
          largest port in Taiwan.
